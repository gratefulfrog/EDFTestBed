from other meter instructions:

COM : GREEN (Black) wire,Power Supply - , Measure Voltage -
PW+ : BLUE (Red) wire, Power Supply +, Measure Voltage +
IN+, YELLOW (Yellow) wire, Measure current input.
Note : Pls connect the YELLOW & GREEN (yellow wire and black wire) together to avoid the Interference when u use the voltmeter function only

Final working for volt measurement:

power supply to device 
red: +12v (min 4.5)
black: 0v (gnd)

Measurement connections

Voltmeter only:
Green: -V (shunt*A) GROUND
Yellow: -V (shunt*B)  load-
Blue: +V  load+

i.e. load current runs:
* from blue (V+),
* to load, 
* to yellow, 
* to shunt, to green which is Ground!
